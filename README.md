## Project Overview

This project investigates the primary drivers influencing the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the United States. The research focuses on evaluating the impact of environmental, economic, and practical factors on PEV sales, offering actionable insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders to promote sustainable transportation.

## Objectives

- **Identify Key Drivers**: Analyze the factors influencing PEV adoption, including CO2 emissions, Tesla stock prices, electricity, and gas prices.
  
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize data analytics to evaluate the relationship between the identified factors and PEV sales, employing statistical models to derive meaningful insights.
  
- **Provide Insights**: Develop actionable recommendations for promoting PEV adoption based on the analysis results.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection**: Gathered data from various reputable sources, including the Department of Energy (DOE), Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), and the World Bank.
  
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy, converting yearly data to a monthly frequency where necessary.
  
- **Statistical Modeling**: Employed an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model to evaluate the relationship between PEV sales and the selected factors. Conducted correlation analysis and multicollinearity checks to refine the model.

- **Visualization**: Developed interactive dashboards using React to visualize the results and provide real-time updates on EV sales trends, CO2 impact, market sentiment, and more.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Utilized for organizing and documenting the data analysis process.
  
- **Git**: Employed for version control, ensuring efficient collaboration and project management.
  
- **React**: Used to build interactive dashboards for visualizing the analysis results.

## Key Findings

- Practical considerations, such as electricity and gas prices, were found to be the most significant factors affecting PEV sales.
  
- Market sentiment, reflected in Tesla stock metrics, also plays a substantial role in driving PEV adoption.
  
- Environmental factors, while important, were less influential compared to economic and practical considerations.

## Conclusion

The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors driving PEV adoption, with a particular emphasis on practical and economic considerations. These findings can help guide policymakers and industry stakeholders in crafting effective strategies to promote the widespread adoption of PEVs and support the transition to sustainable transportation.

## Future Work

- Incorporate more recent data to ensure the model's relevance to current market conditions.
  
- Explore interactions between variables to better understand the combined effects of different factors on PEV adoption.
  
- Expand the analysis to include a broader range of external factors, such as technological advancements and evolving government policies.
